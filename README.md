## About
HelperKelvin is a Discord bot that was made aiming to make the use of the ChatGPT API.

want to host him, here you go

## Planned Features
- Music Player (maybe, discord kinda weird about it lately)
- Moderation Tools
- More Commands

And up-to-date development with the everchanging ChatGPT Features

## Requirements
These are the requirements for this project:
